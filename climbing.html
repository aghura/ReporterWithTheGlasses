	<h2>Note: All essays under the “College Englightenment” section are extracts from my original responses to college questions. I have been helping a few students with their college applications recently, and after much deliberation, I have decided to publish my essays on this website solely to help those students currently engaged with the college application process. I realize that reading prior responses helps lend a sense of direction to students, just like prior responses helped me write these essays. However, please remember, these essays are merely a tool to help you find inspiration and give example. Copying and plagiarizing content would mean lying to oneself and breaking my trust. Think of random moments in life that may have made a small change but impacted you deeply. It’s hard at first, but believe me, as you think deeper, you are bound as a human being to remember stories. You’ll get there, slowly and steadily, and I’m certain you’ll attain satisfaction once the process is over. You can do this! And don’t forget to check out Ethan Sawyer’s website for more amazing college writing content! <br><br><br>

I feel like Mowgli. The wind rushes through my hair, sending chills down my spine. I look down at the tiny people who’ve fixed their gaze upon me. As I climb higher, I struggle to rest my feet on the rock shaped holds. I reach a point wherein the only possibility to go higher, I figure, is by lifting my left leg above my right hand and doing some sort of impossible daredevil stunt. Restricted by my human body, I climb lower, trying to find a different path. The tiny people shout instructions and I follow. My hand can’t reach the handle. I try jumping and eventually fall down by a height of about two stories. I enjoy dangling by the pulley system and land myself like a superhero in movies!<br><br>

Be it writing codes for computer programs or struggling in the middle of a narrative, climbing has taught me the significance of sometimes undoing my work and getting different people’s perspectives. In the end, it’s not always going to work, but that doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy failure and keep trying again till you succeed!
