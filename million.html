	<h2>In first grade I read a chapter about a sad paradoxical dog who was upset because his tail wouldn’t wag like the other dogs in town. It was titled “A Million Wags.” My mother explained how dogs wag their tail when happy. The idea fascinated me. Six years later, my family welcomed our newest member, and after much deliberation, we decided to name him Dennis.</h2>

	<h2>

Have you ever felt joy. An emotion that brims you up and energizes you. You’ve never felt like that before, and you didn’t know that such happiness was ever inside of you. This happiness suddenly appears and you don’t think about the past or the future. You’re immersed in the present, oblivious to all other tense. There is an aura of euphoria. Everything just happens. There is no resistance, just a frictionless flow of elation. And yet, you’re on earth, you’ll never leave it. It defies all science. Your heart pumps and what better way to say it- you’re just happy.
<br><br>
I felt that emotion today. I felt alive today. And suddenly you find your purpose in life. My body struggled on the knocks and corners of the uncomfortable wooden chairs. But then again, they were never meant for sleeping. I had twisted and turned and adjusted and yearned. There is no comfort like that of your own bed, but there are other emotions that drive a person. I was sleeping in the living room! My sleep had died but I didn’t want to get up. My pestering eye-lids decided to remain close, until… “Screeeeeeech”. I knew what that was, it could have been only one thing. My father had arrived. How exciting. He’s finally here I thought to myself. He’s here, he’s here. And so as a result of all these cerebral activities, my legs harnessed some energy and got up. 
<br><br>
My awake eyes, though still droopy due to those dark circles below, glided towards my dog. There he lay, breathing. I knew, I always knew, that today would change me, and it did. Only to realise, every single day since Dennis had been home, I was changing. Changing for the better, becoming kinder. Learning and loving. He had never told me how to be. Some of you might say how could he? He’s a dog. Well, dogs speak, I’ll guarantee you that. I’ve heard them. But there’s a catch- they speak only to those who listen. And yet, this isn’t how he changed me. He inspired me, that’s how he changed me. Without realising, I wanted to be more like my dog. He taught me care and happiness and love and empathy, unconditionally. He has taught me to be brave, to handle all stress and troubles. It’s easy- be happy. Because whenever I’m in doubt, whenever things don’t go as anticipated, or a hurricane is coming, I think what Dennis would do- he would wag his tail and he would lick me, and he would jump on me, and he would taunt me with his paw, telling me,’come on big bro, you gotta pet me’, and slowly and slowly, as my hand scuffed through his golden, mesmerising, fluffy hair, he would fall and go to sleep. All troubles drowned away, they just did. He was magic. He is magic. And there he lay, breathing.
<br><br>
“Papa’s here, Papa’s here”, my heart’s voice had reached my tongue. And that breathing dog got up. He got up. He got up. I’m sorry, as I write, my emotions attack me. I couldn’t help to write that line again. Because I still remember, he got up. 
<br><br>
My dog is suffering cancer. Half his face is paralysed. He has countless tumours running from everywhere to everywhere. He’s restless with pain, tired of it. But then again, he hasn’t lost hope. My dog can’t walk, his tender feet won’t hold him any longer. He can’t eat or drink, hasn’t for 5 days. There’s a tumour in his neck, suffocating him, paining him when he eats or drinks. No matter how hungry he is, no matter how much he yearns for cheese (his favourite dish), there’s an insufferable pain just before that drives all longings away. All he survives on is a drip, administered two times a day. There’s an arrangement of injections I see go in him every day. His mouth droops open, he can’t close it back. His eye reds up, and when it does, it covers the life. The black beauty of his pupil has a red screen. He can’t see. And so we put eye-drops. When he does muster the courage to pee, to get up, he has lost all sense of direction. He’s falling and falling. We need to carry him. But yet, he’ll never urinate or vomit in the house. He’ll fight all that pain and go out. But today, he got up. Joy, not just in me, but my brother, my mother, and my father. Joy.
<br><br>
He got up and he wagged his tail. Oh! And how he wagged his tail! Through all that pain that he had inside, through all that he was going through, death was stopping him, but his love overcame that. He had already won.
<br><br>
I saw tears in my father’s eyes today, the same man who I knew to be so strong, the same army man. The colonel had tears. The last he had seen him, Dennis was the same hyper-active energetic jumping monkey and excited bundle of joy. Today, his cancer had brought tears to his eyes. There’s always a deep heart, the deepest heart, behind any armor. I hugged him, and you know what he said to me-”You are a brave boy”. He said that. He said that. Tears roll down my eyes as I write this, and I think emotions are the best way to express.
<br><br>
I have seen my parents cry. It makes me cry. No matter how much I think I have taken care of my dog, no matter how much I feel I have loved him, my parents have more. Believe me, they have. I might have not realized that up till today, but they have. The same goes for me. They have made sacrifices beyond my capabilities. Parents are beauty. You never know how much they love you, you never can, the quantity is immeasurable.
<br><br>
They say death is what gives life meaning. My thoughts differ. I think they are wrong. I think it is love and friends and family. It’s caring for others before yourselves. My dog has taught me that. He gave me a heart. And I don’t know if death is a thing, I truly don’t. The energy that my dog gives me, even through all of this, I think death is weak. It must be. Because my dog lives in me, in my mother, and in my father. Alas, he gave me a heart, he’s there. I fail to understand how he will ever die. It’s impossible. He just can’t. And even if he has no mortal form, he still is there. Around me always, making me happy, licking me, and taunting me to pet him. I feel him. So how can I say that he can die? He won’t. I know he won’t. Because he loves his family, unconditionally. And his family loves him, unconditionally.
