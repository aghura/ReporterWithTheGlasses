	<h2>Note: All essays under the “College Englightenment” section are extracts from my original responses to college questions. I have been helping a few students with their college applications recently, and after much deliberation, I have decided to publish my essays on this website solely to help those students currently engaged with the college application process. I realize that reading prior responses helps lend a sense of direction to students, just like prior responses helped me write these essays. However, please remember, these essays are merely a tool to help you find inspiration and give example. Copying and plagiarizing content would mean lying to oneself and breaking my trust. Think of random moments in life that may have made a small change but impacted you deeply. It’s hard at first, but believe me, as you think deeper, you are bound as a human being to remember stories. You’ll get there, slowly and steadily, and I’m certain you’ll attain satisfaction once the process is over. You can do this! And don’t forget to check out Ethan Sawyer’s website for more amazing college writing content! <br><br><br>

“Let’s talk periods.” I was introduced to Madame Kiran Gandhi at the Round Square International Conference 2020 hosted by our school. Her story of running the London Marathon, bleeding free, had hooked everyone to what this bold lady had to say. Her personality was stimulating and had fostered an hour-long discussion on the unhygienic conditions of women in rural as well as urban India in our Barazza group. Unsanitary university washrooms, expensive sanitary pads unaffordable to 64% of Indian women, long-standing taboos, and poor menstrual hygiene are just a few problems that stain the lives of women. Of course, the biology class had taught what menstruation is, but due to the lack of health education and awareness among people, most were unaware of this alarming situation. These discussions fostered dialogue on solutions and unraveled so many problems. Be it conversations on fourth-wave feminism, the global menstrual stigmas, or the general problems faced by school-going girls in their day to day lives, it helped me and so many others depose that discomfort of speaking on difficult issues that are rather left ignored and avoided in discussions. I realize that change cannot occur when such difficult issues are avoided. Awareness as well as discussions are imperative for society to tackle these problems and gain a deeper understanding of the extent of the matter.
