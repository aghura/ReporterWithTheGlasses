	<h2>Note: All essays under the “College Englightenment” section are extracts from my original responses to college questions. I have been helping a few students with their college applications recently, and after much deliberation, I have decided to publish my essays on this website solely to help those students currently engaged with the college application process. I realize that reading prior responses helps lend a sense of direction to students, just like prior responses helped me write these essays. However, please remember, these essays are merely a tool to help you find inspiration and give example. Copying and plagiarizing content would mean lying to oneself and breaking my trust. Think of random moments in life that may have made a small change but impacted you deeply. It’s hard at first, but believe me, as you think deeper, you are bound as a human being to remember stories. You’ll get there, slowly and steadily, and I’m certain you’ll attain satisfaction once the process is over. You can do this! And don’t forget to check out Ethan Sawyer’s website for more amazing college writing content! <br><br><br>


Please finish each sentence in 75 characters or less so we can learn more about you. </h2>

How did you first learn about Bowdoin? (140 characters)<br><br></h4><h3>

Learning about Peter Buck, the nuclear physicist who co-founded Subway, I knew that Bowdoin would help me grow in all areas of interest, no matter how wildly apart!</h3><br><br><h4>

Why did you chose this major? (250 characers)<br><br></h4><h3>

“Slide To Unlock,” the vivid screen displayed, and although my family required an hour-long session to decrypt the functioning of an iPhone 4s, I already knew where the camera function was. “Click,” and that was my introduction to modern technology.
