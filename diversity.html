	<h2>Note: All essays under the “College Englightenment” section are extracts from my original responses to college questions. I have been helping a few students with their college applications recently, and after much deliberation, I have decided to publish my essays on this website solely to help those students currently engaged with the college application process. I realize that reading prior responses helps lend a sense of direction to students, just like prior responses helped me write these essays. However, please remember, these essays are merely a tool to help you find inspiration and give example. Copying and plagiarizing content would mean lying to oneself and breaking my trust. Think of random moments in life that may have made a small change but impacted you deeply. It’s hard at first, but believe me, as you think deeper, you are bound as a human being to remember stories. You’ll get there, slowly and steadily, and I’m certain you’ll attain satisfaction once the process is over. You can do this! And don’t forget to check out Ethan Sawyer’s website for more amazing college writing content! <br><br><br>

	<h2>
I believe that my life has been defined by commas: mathematician, computer scientist, educationalist, writer, environmentalist, cyclist, and dog lover. Each of these commas has been achieved through collaboration with uniquely passionate people. Be it my grandfather’s love for mathematics, my best friend’s for nature, my participation in the school literary community, or my own inherent passion for technology, working with others has gained me an enthusiasm for their interests, as well as inspired them with mine. Whether I employ fractals to design antennas, stealth-mode helicopters, and execute image rectification processes, write code to run statistical programs, or use my writing skills to pen witty mini-programs, this variety in interest has enabled me to connect my knowledge in different fields together. With its foundation courses and interdisciplinary education, X College would help me explore multiple subjects and engage with different people so as to keep increasing my character comma count.
