	<h2>This story, along with the blue UNICEF band that plays in animation at the tail of every page, has played a major role in defining the theme of this blog. Eugenia, a scientist residing in a black and white world, has a breakthrough when she invents Color from the memory of her Grandma’s bedtime stories. But our protagonist is an ambitious witch, and while ambition is an entriprising quality, the story throws light upon its dangerous and blinding effect when left untamed. Can Color save himself, or does Eugenia get the best of him? Read more to find out!</h2>

	<h2>
And a pint of succulent barnacles growing off the Ogre’s ear, noted Eugenia, deciding whether her new recipe would require such exorbitant delicacies. As she minced the ingredients, preparing them for the bubbling cauldron, she wondered what color would be like. Her thoughts raced back to ol’ Grammy’s stories, when they’d huddle beside the crackling fireplace and stare at the dancing flames of black and white, each flame a different texture on the greyscale. Grammy had educated her with many stories, but color’s legend had always been her favorite. Grammy had reserved those tales for the most lonely nights, when Eugenia’s parents were off to work trips, and the black bricked house was their’s alone. 
<br><br>
Behind each award that graced her fame and each discovery that relished her grind, Eugenia’s inspiration came from those stories. The tales of the immortal Norwegian trolls, the iPod of the Obrezka goblin, all dawned to reality from Eugenia’s rusty cauldron. It was Eugenia’s way to overcome her isolation, to feel Grammy’s presence in her secluded laboratory hidden amidst the sparkling silver trees of Mango Forest.
<br><br>
“Blistering tails of Obrezka’s dead rat,” she cursed in anguish, unsuccessful in her attempts to discover color. But to Eugenia’s ignorance, something escaped the confinement of her trust-worthy cauldron. Soaked in grey slime and varnished by the mid-day Sun’s silver rays, this something did not belong to any shade of the greyscale. It’s vibrance distinguished itself from the dim backdrop crammed with dusty shelves and bubbling potions. 
<br><br>
Eugenia’s eyes sensed movement. She hurriedly directed herself towards the change. She froze in her tracks, her mind inactive. For years Eugenia had tried imagining color, mixing all the greys of her imagination’s palette, paying heed to every description Grammy talked of. The sparkles enkindled from winter’s icicles, the vibrance of the moon chiseled on the night’s canvas, the silver of trees and the rugged beauty on an old woman’s face, and beyond there lay color, lost in legend away from this treacherous world, Grammy had said. And now, her imagination was reality. Tears trickled down her cheeks, finding way through the maze of her elderly wrinkles and enormously long smile. Her heart pumped with euphoria, and she clasped her hands in frivolous rapture. Seeing this devilish delight, Color escaped to the wilds outside.
<br><br>

<br><br>
Although the residents of Baskerville (a mining town on the outskirts of Mango Forest) have devised numerous theories of the haunted spirits inhabiting Mango Forest, these accusations are simply untrue. Discovered during the reign of Skunk Ape IV of Popobawa, the outline of the forest was cultivated with various Mango trees for its fruit, the mango, a silver fruit used as a toxin for the Batsquatch inhabiting the area. Today, Mango Forest is a thriving region of various undiscovered species of platinum textured fauna, and if journeyed, it would be the perfect destination for an enthralling camping experience. Unfortunately, the residents of Baskerville will never overcome their fears as they are, simply put, pumpkin heads.
<br><br>

<br><br>
The purified air of the forest relieved Color of the gross odor entrapped in Eugenia’s cramped hut. He felt pleasure as the Sun’s rays, creeping through the cracks of the canopy, warmed his enchanting face. While figuring out the nuances of this world outside, Color fascinated himself cracking the dry leaves and dancing to the melody his paws sung. Close by, Eugenia paced his trail silently, adjusting her pupils to the bright grey of the wilderness. She pondered in thought, evaluating methods to extract Color of his brilliance, mind mapping her way to gift her latest feat to the world. 
<br><br>
Blissful in his ignorance, Color didn’t realize Eugenia had caught up, eyeing him secretly in the covert of jungly bushes. His head was consumed in awe as he lost himself amongst the towering trees humming of life. Meanwhile, Eugenia’s thoughts were consumed in wonder as she hooked herself to Color’s shine that spoke to her a Nobel prize. Over the years, Eugenia had nurtured her ambition and assured herself it was solely for the benefit of those around. The recognition and applause had fuelled her further, prompting her arduous efforts to labor day and night. Little did she venture outside her shaggy dwellings, often clueless about the time of day. Without realizing, Eugenia would occasionally make conversation with her husky cauldron and, at times, Grammy’s aging portrait. And yet, her grey cells exhibited dagger-like wits combined with cranium-cracking creativity. 
<br><br>
Planning her play, Eugenia pranced out in anticipation, heading for Color's limbs. But for a person obsessed with intellectual exertion, Eugenia's athletic prowess lacked a certain appeal. Her mindful calculations were pointless in calculating the trajectory of her dance, and "Bloop" she plunged into the gooey, tar-black puddle. "Blistering tails of Obrezka's dead rat," she cursed again, blithering in annoyance. Color giggled at Eugenia's notorious behavior, imitating her failure and taunting her inability to catch him. Eugenia frowned, but somewhere at the back of her head, buried deep amidst scientific facts and theories, there lay a memory frolicking against the corners of her mind, attempting to journey out. Eugenia suppressed it with annoyance. 
<br><br>
The battlefield was set, the horn blown, and Color flaunted his new-born tactics to tease the witch! He glided across the woods, dangling amongst twigs and branches; she broke off the branches. He choreographed his way through this dance floor, hopping by puddles; she splashed in puddles. He crunched on leaves, making his way and dodging by trunks; she smashed  into trunks. And bit by bit, Eugenia salvaged her survival instinct. Adrenaline rushed through her veins, and her puny legs gained control. Her spine corrected her bodily posture while her hand regained command, no longer influenced by gushing winds. And bit by bit, that memory at the back reignited its existence, struggling to emerge at the top of her cerebrum, suppressed by Eugenia's ignorance.
<br><br>
The autumn winds swooshed across the setting. Jackalopes pranced through the woods, hidden amidst the screens of silvering bushes. Mother geese flapped their wings, exploring for crunchy bugs and slimy worms to feed their chittering hungry hatchlings. The gusty autumn scent swayed through the landscape, with the craggy leaves sailing through the air. Autumn was doing what autumn does. And somewhere in the occasion was Eugenia, reliving her childhood moments with Color. The suppressed memory had made advancements, finally gaining respect of its existence. Eugenia remembered the lively games she'd play with Grammy, packed with an unsettling urge to never stop. Grammy would lose on purpose: her joy was in seeing Eugenia proud and carefree. To keep her act from being obvious, she'd sometimes astonish Eugenia with her sudden expertise in the art of playing. And without much credit to the winner, young Eugenia would sulk at her loss, eventually accepting being outsmarted.
<br><br>
"Hmmm," wondered Eugenia, planning to imitate Grammy when she won. Executing her idea, Eugenia hid herself amidst the greyscale flora, camouflaging herself in the cracks of outgrown autumn leaves that seemed to resemble her own aged grey face. The misfortunes of a bumpy adventure, with leaves and mud pasted on her, helped her blend into the background. Color stopped clueless, boggled about the whereabouts of his catcher. He traced back his steps, vigilant in his movement but proud of his play, just like young Eugenia. Armed with patience this time, Eugenia awaited Color's arrival, ten steps, five, a few more, and triumph.
<br><br>
The stink of Eugenia's den once again fumed through Color's nostrils. He lay strapped, legs apart and arms raised. His belly was the source, deduced Eugenia. She sharpened her blades and extracted the potions. "Buhawhawhawhaw," incessant devilish laughter echoed across the room. Color was no longer enjoying this game.
<br><br>
She began her operation with all sorts of twirly saws and absurd tools gripped in her hands. Excruciating pain flushed Color. His eyes burned with tears and tongue moaned with hurt. Bullets shot through his nerves, and blood crammed his heart. He was powerless in his efforts, and he couldn't stop her. "For science, for science," muttered Eugenia, comforting herself of her actions. It has to be done, she reassured herself, for the benefit of this world. But it was too late, Color had died, taking away his glory and joy, frozen to stone, void of his vibrance and lifeless in black and white. The world was black and white.
<br><br>
She was right when she said this treacherous world didn't deserve color. Grammy was right. Eugenia struggled to revive Color, tears trailing her dehydrated cheeks. The world didn't matter anymore, she longed for company, and she longed back her life. She yearned back those days with Grammy, those warm nights in her company. The restless spirit she once was.
<br><br>
And still, eternal facts remain unchanged: what is dead cannot be brought back. Color reserved his dwellings in Eugenia's mind, close to Grammy's frenzy adventures; he was a pigment coloring Eugenia's thoughts with the hues of vibrant joy, a memory.
