	<h2>Note: All essays under the “College Englightenment” section are extracts from my original responses to college questions. I have been helping a few students with their college applications recently, and after much deliberation, I have decided to publish my essays on this website solely to help those students currently engaged with the college application process. I realize that reading prior responses helps lend a sense of direction to students, just like prior responses helped me write these essays. However, please remember, these essays are merely a tool to help you find inspiration and give example. Copying and plagiarizing content would mean lying to oneself and breaking my trust. Think of random moments in life that may have made a small change but impacted you deeply. It’s hard at first, but believe me, as you think deeper, you are bound as a human being to remember stories. You’ll get there, slowly and steadily, and I’m certain you’ll attain satisfaction once the process is over. You can do this! And don’t forget to check out Ethan Sawyer’s website for more amazing college writing content! <br><br><br>


Due to a series of clerical errors, there is exactly one typo (an extra letter, a removed letter, or an altered letter) in the name of every department at the University of Chicago. Oops! Describe your new intended major. Why are you interested in it and what courses or areas of focus within it might you want to explore? Potential options include Commuter Science, Bromance Languages and Literatures, Pundamentals: Issues and Texts, Ant History… a full list of unmodified majors ready for your editor’s eye is available here. —Inspired by Josh Kaufman, AB’18</h2>

The repetitive beat of the background music amplifies, interrupted only by the disc jockey’s scrubbing turntablist technique. The location is pitch black until the laser lights finally illuminate the setting. The mirrored disco ball sparkles its brilliance as it hovers above the dance floor. The floor is packed with people following the rhythm of the beat, except for one peculiar individual who remains firmly in his seat. He doesn’t move, doesn’t speak. This peculiar individual is me!
<br><br>
I discovered my inability to dance at a young age. Although my parents had persuaded me to participate in numerous dance competitions and events, I lacked the ability to figure out the moves and choreograph my steps when dancing freely. My arms dangled at best and flailed at worst, without any sense of purpose to their movements. People would hoot, not out of rapture or excitement, but at my attempts to figure out the nuances of this perplexing human expression as I stepped on their toes. Weddings and parties left me apprehensive and frankly anxious of the coming dance, frightened of the one family member who would inevitably always manage to pull me onto that daunting floor. Losing all hope, my mind had lost faith in my ability to learn dancing. That was, however, until I finally learned about a distinguished academic institution explicitly dedicated to assisting challenged dancers such as myself.
<br><br>
UChicago’s courses on Dancer Biology have reinstated my suppressed aspiration to become a dancer. Through its numerous research and fellowship opportunities, I can conduct my own study into the ecology of different dances and dancers worldwide and draw connections between the multiple dancing styles ranging from the Punjabi Bhangra to the Western Ballet. Furthermore, the university’s Study Abroad program will afford me the opportunity to interact with accomplished dancers on a personal level, helping me gain knowledge of their unique styles, be it the Gavotte of France or the traditional Chinese Lion Dance. The emphasis on Bellular Biology enables me to learn more about traditional Arabic belly dancing, and the study of Bendocrinology will allow me to investigate unanswered questions about whether dancers actually have a recognizable skeletal structure as well as let me dig deeper into the science of their flexibility.
<br><br>
Even more, UChicago’s focus on its STEM program will encourage me to exhibit my passion for mathematics and computer science by enabling me to map the modes of auditory-motor timings and synchronization of the various bodily processes in dancers. This, in turn, would help me analyze the evolutionary biology of dancers that may be rooted in their neural and cognitive mechanisms. I will finally be able to answer whether my inability in dancing may be a genetic disorder due to bellular mutations, or just a physiological disability requiring practice and persistence. Using this research, I could even code my own program using Arduino and AI, all under the supervision of the UChicago faculty working on accelerated AI Innovation, to design software helping people like me learn to dance! The opportunities allow me to connect the anatomical study of the human body in regards to dance and biology with the latest technological advancements in the field of computing.
<br><br>
Through this unique program, UChicago embodies a true liberal arts education encouraging collaboration between scientists and artists to enable students to express themselves through their unique and diverse interests. It offers me the possibility of following my passions and improving myself, not only academically, but also as a repressed dancer, liberating my inner John Travolta through its immersive extra-curricular programs such as the Festival of the Arts, scavenger hunts, and internship and community service opportunities. It is thus that I wish to be a part of this empathizing community so that one day, when the background music amplifies in volume, interrupted by the disc jockey’s scrubbing turntablist technique, I can finally express myself in sync with the music.
