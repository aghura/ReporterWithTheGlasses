	<h2>Note: All essays under the “College Englightenment” section are extracts from my original responses to college questions. I have been helping a few students with their college applications recently, and after much deliberation, I have decided to publish my essays on this website solely to help those students currently engaged with the college application process. I realize that reading prior responses helps lend a sense of direction to students, just like prior responses helped me write these essays. However, please remember, these essays are merely a tool to help you find inspiration and give example. Copying and plagiarizing content would mean lying to oneself and breaking my trust. Think of random moments in life that may have made a small change but impacted you deeply. It’s hard at first, but believe me, as you think deeper, you are bound as a human being to remember stories. You’ll get there, slowly and steadily, and I’m certain you’ll attain satisfaction once the process is over. You can do this! And don’t forget to check out Ethan Sawyer’s website for more amazing college writing content!

All men are mortal.
Socrates is a man.
Therefore, Socrates is mortal.
<br><br>
To most, these sentences signify mere common sense. To those well-versed in Aristotelian ideas, these sentences are the basic form of a syllogism or deductive reasoning. Investigating further, however, these sentences may just be considered the foundation of a technological era over 2000 years before the first functional computer.
<br><br>
Tracing back into the origins of computing, it may be reasonable to conclude that Aryabhatta was a computer engineer, René Descartes a software engineer, Ramon Llull a computer programmer, and Aristotle was the founder of computer science! Although it may seem absurd, the oft-ignored a priori of the digital world, ancient philosophy has shaped the modern era through its astrological theories, religious philosophies, and deliberation on rational judgment and mathematical logic. Subjects that were once considered abstract with no conceivable applications later sowed the seeds of information technology, allowing human beings to manage tasks which, until relatively recently, would have been seen as nothing short of magic.
<br><br>
Imagine Plato typing The Apology up as a Microsoft Word document and Socrates posting selfies on the latest iPhone. Mathematical logic in ancient times attempted to describe rational thoughts. Building on the ideas of their predecessors, philosophers continued improving and generalizing ideas beyond philosophy and religion. Just like René Descartes generalized Euclid’s geometrical shapes into mathematical formulas, George Boole generalized Aristotle’s Organon into his book The Laws of Thought, creating the field of mathematical logic from what was previously considered human intuition. “All men are mortal” could now be represented as two sets with “men” and “mortal” representing variables X and Y. Thus, everything in set X also existed in set Y. The Law of the Excluded Middle expanded into Boolean logic. Intertwining his knowledge of Boole’s works with his engineering skills, Claude Shanon later gave metaphorical birth to what are now called transistors, the fundamental building blocks of computer circuitry.
<br><br>
Similarly, even computer software has traveled a long way, starting from Descartes’s mathematical formulas to making history through the works of Ramon Llull, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Gottlob Frege, and eventually of Alan Turing. Leibniz’s idea of creating an ideographic language that could represent all scientific and mathematic concepts, inspired by the religious philosopher Ramon Llull, came into reality with the works of Gottlob Frege. By developing mathematical notations, Frege, through his language, identified the distinction between syntax and semantics. A bunch of meaningless symbols, when arranged by syntactic rules, would then signify meaning. It was after that that Alan Turing showed how data and programs could be stored inside a computer, a discovery leading to the development of computer software.
<br><br>
Oftentimes we contrast the computer’s seeming inhumanity with human intuition, not realizing it is our own intuition and philosophical study of the mind, body, and spirit that over time gave us this technology! Writing computer programs today is nothing but the use of deductive reasoning, syntax, mathematical variables, and various other concepts whose roots may be found originating in these age-long philosophical ideas. It is enthralling to think that going back centuries and millennia through such old texts, examining the words of those wise, old bearded philosophers, might just give us another breakthrough into the yet undiscovered future!
