	<h2>Note: All essays under the “College Englightenment” section are extracts from my original responses to college questions. I have been helping a few students with their college applications recently, and after much deliberation, I have decided to publish my essays on this website solely to help those students currently engaged with the college application process. I realize that reading prior responses helps lend a sense of direction to students, just like prior responses helped me write these essays. However, please remember, these essays are merely a tool to help you find inspiration and give example. Copying and plagiarizing content would mean lying to oneself and breaking my trust. Think of random moments in life that may have made a small change but impacted you deeply. It’s hard at first, but believe me, as you think deeper, you are bound as a human being to remember stories. You’ll get there, slowly and steadily, and I’m certain you’ll attain satisfaction once the process is over. You can do this! And don’t forget to check out Ethan Sawyer’s website for more amazing college writing content! <br><br><br>

Reflect on a belief or opinion held by you, which you questioned and examined. What initiated your questioning? Describe the intellectual process you undertook to examine this belief or opinion.Explain the results of your reflection and the changes you saw in your belief or opinion.</h2>

“Once upon a time, there was a crocodile.” Often, as a second-grader, I’d be seen chewing the end of my pencil and scribbling stories on a pack of sticky notes, but in the end, I was never wholly satisfied with the stories I wrote. When taught the idea of “brainstorming, drafting, editing, and revising” in my school in New York, I was initially reluctant to transform my swift writing style into this long structured process, boasting of a “superior” ability in writing. However, participation among my peers, sharing ideas and progressing narratives sentence by sentence, helped me learn different styles and exposed me to other authors’ unique perspectives. As I brainstormed various elements such as the description of the five senses and drafted narratives with the aim to “show” and not “tell,” I sensed my stories improving. Even today, I’m seen chewing the end of my pencil and scribbling stories on a pack of sticky notes, but in the end, I truly enjoy the stories I write.
