	<h2>Note: All essays under the “College Englightenment” section are extracts from my original responses to college questions. I have been helping a few students with their college applications recently, and after much deliberation, I have decided to publish my essays on this website solely to help those students currently engaged with the college application process. I realize that reading prior responses helps lend a sense of direction to students, just like prior responses helped me write these essays. However, please remember, these essays are merely a tool to help you find inspiration and give example. Copying and plagiarizing content would mean lying to oneself and breaking my trust. Think of random moments in life that may have made a small change but impacted you deeply. It’s hard at first, but believe me, as you think deeper, you are bound as a human being to remember stories. You’ll get there, slowly and steadily, and I’m certain you’ll attain satisfaction once the process is over. You can do this! And don’t forget to check out Ethan Sawyer’s website for more amazing college writing content! <br><br><br>


The lessons we take from obstacles we encounter can be fundamental to later success. Recount a time when you faced a challenge, setback, or failure. How did it affect you, and what did you learn from the experience?</h2>

“Keeeeeehaaaaaaaaaa” my larynx screamed as I kicked out like that eponymous martial arts master in old Korean movies. The wooden planks still did not break! I tried again; this moment was precious. It was the test for my black belt with two years of hard work and training behind me leading to this day of judgement. “Aryaman, you have to do it now”, I whispered to myself. “Keeeehaaaaa”, and the wood splintered. 
The fact that the achiever is expected to give an acceptance speech after attaining a black belt was a truth that was kept from me throughout all those years in training. Suddenly, the “Keeeeha” in me faltered. Through my efforts to voice my joy that was momen-tarily handling a heart throbbing with success, my foggy memory doesn’t allow me to remember much, but soon enough, the moment was over, and the speech passed. Taekwondo had surprised me with every passing belt. It finally flabbergasted me with stage fright.
<br><br>
Spindly legs, salt-stained head, soaked dobok and a squeaky voice: these aren’t my recollection of adolescence. I passed that stage long back, but these images lingered on. I’ve ruled out the possibility that I’m a different species of ‘human’, and instead understand the hypochondriac suffering serious stage fright. On the one highly dis-infected hand, I don’t remember when I developed this nervous disorder, but on the other highly sanitised hand, this is the story of how I conquered it.
<br><br>
I searched in vain for a secret vaccine to assist in forming the req-uisite antibodies. The fear constrained me as that shy introvert. I wished to be more free. Google taught me power poses, older stu-dents taught me indifference, and I continued to try to participate in public speaking, volunteering always with my eyes tight shut. 
<br><br>
My first participation reaped no harvest, I hardly spoke a word. My second brought me the first prize: I was to read my thoughts on stage. As a writer who was prompted to quill his views and stories, it essentially became a lie for me to win. The award graced my hands, but I had taken baby steps into getting accustomed to that pulpit’s environment. I yearned for my thoughts to be clear in the mind as I spoke, and convey the confidence I so did not feel and that longed-for quality had yet a very long journey before it was to be achieved. I took to drama and enacted Einstein in a crazy spirit. The school roared in laughter, and people started ‘seeing’ me. “There’s the Einstein guy”, they said. But I still freaked out at the apprehension of the likelihood of all things going wrong next time around. 
<br><br>
Practice and participation in different theatrical excursions in re-peated attempts to make the stage my buddy, were usually accom-panied by the fear that still warned me of all things scary. I tried harder and harder, slowly killing the fear and little by little.
<br><br>
Until one day…as my pupils adjusted to the blinding stage lighting, the audience slowly came into focus. About five hundred students and teachers staring back at me, a modes, ordinary, regular crowd for the massive Indian population. The microphone gripped in my hand, the voice that erupted from the speakers was mine. It didn’t squeak, my legs didn’t freeze, and I smiled in genuine happiness as the cure was complete. I had achieved my black belt. My eyes no longer blinked in anxiety as all those people stared back as into my very soul. Without my cognisance then, the audience was laughing to see my uniform untucked and disorderly, my whole appearance unkempt; in India, that’s a funny joke. But it didn’t matter what the audience thought, and it didn’t matter if I won the apparent prize, I had already won the real one. 
<br><br>
I finally knew what the vaccine was: untuck your shirt and breathe.
